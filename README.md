# Spatio-Directional Clustering for Soccer Actions Pattern Discovery
We study unsupervised discovery of spatio-directional action structures in professional soccer by clustering each on-ball action using its start location on the pitch and its direction (angle). We propose a Bregman soft-clustering approach for exponential-family mixtures, reformulating EM in expectation-parameter (dual) space so that M-steps reduce to Bregman centroid updates (weighted averages of sufficient statistics). This yields closed-form parameter updates for a bivariate Gaussian location model and a von Mises directional model, avoiding the numerical optimization typically required for von Mises concentration by using accurate analytic inverses of the mean resultant length. We instantiate this framework in two modeling strategies: (I) a Two-layer hierarchical mixture that clusters locations first and then directions conditional on location clusters, and (II) a One-shot mixture that clusters location and direction jointly via a shared latent component. We benchmark multiple EM variants (classical vs. Bregman M-steps, optional C-step hard reclassification, and several initializations) on StatsBomb event data from the 64 matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup across ten action types. Empirically, the One-shot scheme dominates the Two-layer alternative on BIC/ICL and computational efficiency across most configurations, while Bregman M-steps provide consistent speedups and often modest fit improvements; scaling experiments further indicate linear runtime growth in sample size.
